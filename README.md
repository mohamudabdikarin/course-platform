LearnEase: Online Courses
About This Project
LearnEase helps people learn and teach online. It is a simple system for managing courses. Students can find and take classes. Teachers can create and manage their courses. We want this app to look great. It should be easy to use on any device.

This project is made by 7 React developers. We are building a useful web app.

What It Does
Our system will have these main parts:

User Login: Students and teachers can sign in.

Find Courses: Look through all available courses.

Course Pages: See details about each class.

Student Page: Students track their classes and progress.

Teacher Page: Teachers manage their course content.

Works Everywhere: The app looks good on phones, tablets, and computers.

Clean Code: Our code is easy to read and update.

Our Design Guide
We are building this app using a Figma design. It guides how the app looks.

You can see the design here:

Tools We Use
React.js: For building the app's look.

Vite: To set up and run the app fast.

React Router DOM: For moving between pages.

Tailwind CSS: For styling our pages quickly.

React-icons: For app icons.

React Context API: To manage app data.

Fetch API: To get data from online services.

[Specify your API/Backend choice here, e.g., JSON Server for mock data, Firebase, Supabase, or a custom backend]

Git & GitHub: For teamwork and code storage.
